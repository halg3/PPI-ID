# DDIP
This is a structural bioinformatics tool that aids domain-domain, domain-motif, or motif-motif interactions prediction between proteins. This tool was designed to help researchers refine inputted amino acid sequences when predicting protein-protein interactions using AlphaFold Multimer. To use, provide protein domain or small linear motif (SLiM) information generated by either InterPro or the ELM database. Interaction predictions, as sorted in increasing order of combined probability of the sequence of each domain/SLiM occurring by chance, can be downloaded as a tsv by the user. After running predictions on AlphaFold, the user is able to upload the resulting PDB file and interact with the data frame of predicted interactions. Please note that in order for data frame and the 3D molecular model to properly interact, the sequences submitted to InterPro/ELM must be the exact same as the sequences that were folded. Also note that the order of protein sequences folded in AlphaFold must match that of Protein 1 and Protein 2 tsv uploaded to the tool.
